# Amortization-Schedule
## Purpose
An amortization schedule is a way to track how much money one pays in principal and interest over time when paying off a debt. This application is a simple webpage that takes in total loan amount, length of the loan, and the loan's interest rate in order to calculate and generate a table/chart to display monthly expenses for a home loan. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML defines the structure of the page, including the form, table, and chart. CSS is used to style these elements in a more visually appealing and accesible way. The Javascript script file handles all the calculations of the data entered by the user, as well as manipulates the DOM in a way that provides a more user friendly experience.
## Running the Project
In order to run the project, the style, script, and index files must be included in the same directory. Afterwards, the HTML index file can be opened in a web-browser to be parsed. The script and style files are linked externally in the HTML.

An alternative option is to use an extension such as Live Server in VSCode or Atom Live Server in Atom, which allows for a development localhost server to be conviniently started from the IDE.
Also note that **chart.js** is used to create the chart within the webpage. It is loaded using a CDN in the HTML using a script element.
